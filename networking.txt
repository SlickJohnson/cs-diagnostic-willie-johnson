When you type in a url and press enter you send an HTTP/s request to the website.
Your DNS dictates how the information is sent and how the response is recieved.
The information you send and receive are called "packets".
These packets are sent along a TCP and/or UDP connection and if there is no connection nothing will be sent.
This can be resolved with portforwarding. The machine that sends the request is known as the Client and the machine that recieves that request is known as a Server.
